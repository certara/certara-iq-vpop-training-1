# Virtual Population Training 1

This project introduces the Virtual Population (VPop) training workflow in Certara IQ, demonstrating how  mechanistic models
can be used to simulate diverse virtual patients after calibrating a virtual population against observed data.

## Overview

### Objective:
Train and evaluate a virtual population that matches observed data distributions using Certara IQâ€™s modeling and simulation framework.

### Core workflow:

Propose candidate patient parameterizations

Simulate the model across all proposals

Select those forming a population consistent with observed or target distributions

## Where to start

Begin with `training_1_vpop.ipynb`. There is an accompanying solution file.
